This process will likely take time as all parties involved gather and analyze the necessary information.",
    "Opportunities that may arise": "The investigations into the sexual assault allegations against Conor McGregor present an opportunity for justice to be served and for the truth to be revealed. If the allegations are proven to be true, it could lead to significant consequences for McGregor and send a message about the importance of accountability in sports.",
